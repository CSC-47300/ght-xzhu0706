Syllabus Qs
-----------------------
1. I'm interested in learning the topics that I have never got in touch before, such as GraphQL, GatsbyJS, etc.
2. I noticed that we have a "testing" topic in our syllabus, I want to know if we're going to use some tools to do automated testing, or just manual testing.
3. What scares me might be that we want to create a web app that is competitive with applications in Zach competition, this sounds challenging.
